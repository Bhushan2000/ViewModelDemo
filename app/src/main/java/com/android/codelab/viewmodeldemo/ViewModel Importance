 In this application a random no generate from 1-9
 when the application is in portrait mode there is no problem.
 but when screen rotates and configuration changes then the random data again generated and the previous data loosed.
 Data not retained.

 To overcome this issue we use ViewModel which preserve the data when activity is created and give same data
  when configuration changes.

  Advantages:
  1) Not created new number
  2) This will reduce lot of task a lot of time in case you are fetching the data from the Network

  3) ViewModel only destroyed when the activity is completely destroyed.
